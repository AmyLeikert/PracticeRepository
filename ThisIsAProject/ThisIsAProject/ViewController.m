/*I am adding lots of comments down here so we can play around with it. Woohoo, here goes some more comments. In fact, let me share a monologue
 
 "If by your art, my dearest father, you have
 Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
 The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
 But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
 Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
 With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
 Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
 Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
 Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
 Had I been any god of power, I would
 Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
 It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
 The fraughting souls within her."
